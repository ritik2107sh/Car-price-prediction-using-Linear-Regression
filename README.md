# Car-price-prediction-using-Linear-Regression

Description: Built a predictive model to forecast car sales using linear regression techniques. This project involved data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation of car sales data to provide insights and future sales predictions.
Key Achievements:

Imported and cleaned the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
Visualized the data trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn for a better understanding of features.
Applied statistical methods and developed a linear regression model to predict car sales.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like RÂ², mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
